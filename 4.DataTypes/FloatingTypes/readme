The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. 
We should end the value with an "F" for floats and "D" for doubles:

Double:
It can print up to 14 digit.
Float:
It can print up to 7 digit correctly.


A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10
